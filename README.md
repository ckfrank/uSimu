# uSimu
This development project aims at automating the submission and feedback process for microprocessor simulation tasks. In detail, the final product of this development project will be an web based platform with front-end interface and back-end server/ databases, etc. The platform can accept submitted code from students and automatically compile the code with the selected microprocessor at the background. The server will log the result and and return feedbacks to the student. The platform can be managed by the lecturer to adjust microprocessor settings and authorization settings.
